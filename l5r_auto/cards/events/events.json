This is an attempt to stop the prophecy from coming to be fulfilled. While the heist at Kyuden Miya goes off without a hitch, the one in the Lion lands does not. The Scorpion are able to deftly avoid the Lion's attention, but the Kitsu have employed the aide of their ancestral spirits to protect major Lion fortifications during the war, and the spirits raise the alarm. When this happens, the leader of the team and the greatest ninja of the Scorpion (also Bayushi Kwanchai's daughter) inadvertently sets off her own legacy and the spirits of gaki-do rush to her defense. Shiro Ikoma quickly becomes the site of a battle between the spirit armies of the blessed ancestors and the hungry dead, giving the Scorpion time to escape and confusing the Lion to no end."
